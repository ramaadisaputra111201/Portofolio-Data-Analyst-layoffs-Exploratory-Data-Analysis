The first step was to identify the maximum values of total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off. The results revealed that some companies conducted massive layoffs, with several even reaching 100% of their workforce. Furthermore, companies with percentage_laid_off = 1 indicated that several well-funded startups still failed to survive due to an imbalance between investment and operational efficiency.

Subsequent analysis focused on identifying companies and industries with the highest total layoffs. Aggregation results showed that the technology, finance, and consulting sectors were the most affected, while the United States dominated global layoff figures. A time-based analysis using the date column revealed that the largest surge occurred in 2022–2023, coinciding with the post-pandemic recovery phase and major restructuring within technology firms.

In addition, analysis by funding stage showed that most layoffs occurred during the Series B–C and Post-IPO phases, reflecting efficiency strategies following periods of rapid expansion. Monthly and cumulative analyses demonstrated a consistent increase in layoffs from mid-2022 to early 2023. Finally, using window functions (RANK and DENSE_RANK), the top five companies with the highest layoffs each year were identified, providing a clear view of the most affected organizations over time.

Overall, the EDA results highlight that large funding does not guarantee workforce stability, and the technology sector remains the most vulnerable to global economic shifts. This analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding labor restructuring trends and supports decision-makers in mapping business risks and strategic planning for the future.
